## Motivation

Living in Japan as a foreigner presents unique challenges, particularly when dealing with official documentation. Language barriers, complex bureaucratic processes, and unfamiliarity with local systems can make simple tasks feel overwhelming. WiLDoc was conceived to address these pain points by providing:

1. **Immediate Understanding**: Transform complex Japanese documents into clear, understandable summaries
2. **Language Accessibility**: Break down language barriers through AI-powered translations and explanations
3. **Cultural Context**: Provide cultural and procedural context to help users navigate Japanese bureaucratic systems
4. **Time Efficiency**: Reduce the time and stress involved in processing official documents

Our goal is to empower foreigners in Japan with the tools they need to live more confidently and independently.
